# Accessing your @uc.pt with gmail

This is a quick step by step guide on how to configure your @uc.pt email address to be able to access it within the gmail environment. 
Motivation for pursuing this is to have access to all the nice features that gmail offers for managing emails, including shortcuts!
Please refer back to the original guides from UC [here](https://www.uc.pt/sgsiic/correio_eletronico) that include instructions on how to configure it with the Outlook, Apple Mail, and Thunderbird.

Nota: this guide was written in english because that is the default language of my machine and gmail account. Contributions are welcome to translate it to Portuguese, which would make total sense!

- open gmail
- click the cog wheel on top rigth corner
- click "see all settings" button
- select "accounts and import" tab
- scroll down to "Check mail from other accounts"
- click "add a mail account"
- enter your @uc.pt email address and click next

- on this screen for me it only gave me the option for using "Import emails from my other account (POP3)", so click next

- on the next screen: 
  - insert your email address again in the username field
  - insert your password in the password field
  - (optional) check "leave a copy..." if you want to keep a copy of the incoming emails on your [webmail](https://apps.uc.pt/mail)
  - (optional) check "Label incoming..." if you want gmail to automatically add this label to incoming messages on your @uc.pt address (recommended)
- click "Add Account"

It might prompt you to continue configuring this @uc.pt as an alias, which allows you to actually send emails, from your gmail, as the @uc.pt email address. Here are the steps to configure that:

- on the gmail settings page ("Accounts and Import" tab), scroll down to the "Send mail as:" section
- click "Add another email address"
- set your preferred name, insert your email address, and click "next step"

- on the next screen:
  - change the "SMTP Server" field to: mail.uc.pt
  - insert your @uc.pt email address in the username field
  - insert your password in the password field
  - leave "Secured TLS" option selected
  - click "Add Account"

That's it. You will now start receiving emails that are sent to your @uc.pt email address and will be able to reply to them (as well as send new emails) as your @uc.pt email account!

Contributions to this guide are welcome, especially if you can reproduce this with the interface in Portguese and take the equivalent screenshots.
