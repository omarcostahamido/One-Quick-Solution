Hello all :)

How can I change the value of a certain wekinator output through MAX? what kind of OSC message should I use?

Thank you for your time

Hello Omar,

Thank you for your time and help

Picture this: In recording mode, I send a string of values to wekinator as input(s), and each time I do that, I want to tell wekinator what value each output will have. Each iteration will have different output values. Did you understand? So I need a way of telling wekinator the value of each output per iteration (each time I input a string).

I can explain you my project in detail if you're interested

Thank you again,

Jorge

hey Jorge,

I think I'm starting to get it, you want to define weks output while you're still in the training process.

Yeah, I would like to know more about your project. ;)

Best, Omar
