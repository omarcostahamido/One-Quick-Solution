I made a patch and two abstractions to help check for the "7 kind of forbidden errors" (I.1 to I.7).
Replace the contents of the top 2 message boxes and click them to send their information. och.amadinda-generator will calculate how many times to duplicate okwawula, and join the two. Then click the message box in the middle to send the 24 note melody to och.amadonda-errorcheck to check for errors. Errors will be displayed in max window.
